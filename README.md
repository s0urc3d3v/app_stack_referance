.add(n, v) is repeptented by <sup>512</sup>∑<sub>n = 1</sub> m[n] = v

.pop() is repensened by <sup>512</sup>∑<sub>n = 1</sub> m[n] = null

.get() is reprensented by <sup>512></sup>∑<sub>n = 1</sub>m[n]

#*Why*

This framework allows for easy 
and effeinct storage of data that can be accessed quickly and is dynamic with simple methods.  It is greate because it has a very small footprint and even less of hastle then others of it's kind
